## Deployment:

> Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

**3: Excelling.** The deployed app works just like the local one!

## Technical Requirements:

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**2: Performing.** Great job with this project. Thought your system for handling the game damage was very clever and concise. Awesome that you incorporated an additional library -- jQuery UI -- to make the game more interesting. I think there are some additional simple features you can implement that won't require that much work but will make the user experience much better. Take a look at my thoughts in the code comments.

## Code Quality:

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

**2: Performing.** Your code was very consistent when it came to spacing and indentation. One strong suggestion is to remove commented-out code and debugging console.log statements from your final submission. They take away from code readability. If you would like to keep them, consider doing that in a separate non-master branch.

## Creativity/Interface:

> Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**2: Performing.** Dig the theme! Very fun spin on the Tower of Hanoi concept. Again, think there are some quick ways you can improve the user experience. Make sure to take a look at my code comments.
