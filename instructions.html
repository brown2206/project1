      <h1>POWER TOWER OF HANOI</h1>
      <p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The objective of POWER TOWER OF HANOI is to move the entire stack of weights to the 3rd stack.</li>
          <li>Only the top weight of each stack can be moved at a time.</li>
          <li>In this game, a successful SELECTION and DROP consists of a 2-click cycle.</li>
          <ul>
              <li>The 1st click of the maroon colored base of a stack selects the weight that sits ATOP of that stack.</li>
              <li>The 2nd click of a maroon colored base of a stack moves your selected weight to the very TOP of that stack.</li>
              <li>As a user, you will continue to SELECT and DROP weights using this 2-click process.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>If the 1st weight that you've SELECTED is lighter than the weight that you'd like to DROP on, then your weight drop will be successful.</li>
          <li>If the first weight that you've SELECTED is heavier than the weight that you'd like to DROP on, then your move will be rejected.</li>
      </ul>
